# .NET Interactive Samples

This folder contains a number of samples that you can use to explore features of .NET Interactive.

* [`docker-image`](docker-image/readme.md) contains a Dockerfile that generates an image with the latest .NET Interactive and Jupyter. This lets you try out .NET Interactive's Jupyter experience without needing to install Jupyter directly. 

* [`extensions`](extensions/readme.md) contains sample projects that provide examples of how to create shareable .NET Interactive extensions and publish them using NuGet packages.
